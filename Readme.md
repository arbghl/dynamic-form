This angular module is used to generate a form at runtime. You can add as many fields as you like without having to write a piece of cod.
This is achieved using a JSON object. Create a new filed ini the JSON and ther you go you have added a new field in the form which works fine with alla the basic validations.

This is work in progress and please expect it to change quite drastically. :)
